                   Life has been a journey of curiosity, learning, and self-discovery. From a young age, I’ve always been fascinated by how things work and how people think. That curiosity naturally led me into the world of tech, where I could create, explore, and solve problems in tangible ways.
                 But my life outside tech is just as important. I value creativity, human connection, and personal growth, and these interests influence the projects I build and the impact I want to make in the world.

                <h2>My Story</h2>
                <p>In the past few years, I’ve focused on learning frontend development and exploring innovative tech projects. Some highlights include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>AI Mental Wellness Platform:</strong> I designed a digital space where users can safely explore and understand their emotions. It’s a project close to my heart because it combines tech with mental health advocacy.</li>
                    <li><strong>E-commerce Website Project</strong>Building a platform for an accessories store allowed me to apply both frontend and backend concepts in practical ways.</li>
                    <li><strong>Preparing For First Jamb:</strong> I prepared for my first Jamb by studying hard and practicing consistently.</li>
                    <li><strong>Multi-tasking between project from internships to apprenticeship to Studying:</strong> I was able to balance my time effectively and prioritize my tasks.</li>
                </ul>
                <section id="life-outside-tech">
  <h2>Life Outside Tech</h2>
  <p>
    While tech occupies a big part of my life, I also spend time nurturing my other passions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Creative Design:</strong> Running my graphics design brand has allowed me to express myself visually and explore branding and storytelling.</li>
    <li><strong>Mental Health Awareness:</strong> I’m passionate about understanding human behavior and creating tools or projects that help people cope and grow.</li>
    <li><strong>Personal Growth:</strong> I enjoy reflecting, learning from experiences, and exploring hobbies that inspire curiosity and balance.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These experiences shape not just the projects I work on but also who I am as a person.

                <h2>Moving Forward</h2>
                <p>
                    My journey so far has been a blend of learning, challenges, and exciting discoveries. I’m motivated to continue growing, building meaningful projects, and making a positive impact through both tech and life experiences.

Continuous Growth: Every project, experience, and hobby shapes not just my skills but also who I am as a person. They remind me that true growth comes from both professional achievements and personal reflection.

Looking Ahead: I’m excited to keep exploring new ideas, learning from experiences, and creating projects that combine my passions for tech, creativity, and mental health awareness.
